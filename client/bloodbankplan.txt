    Who exactly will use the site? Only hospitals, only blood donors, or both?
    Hospitals, donors, and even individuals. Anyone looking to buy blood,

    
 Will hospitals need their own login (dashboard) to manage blood requests and records?
 The feature to allow hospitals have their own landing page and domain on our website is a good idea but it is for the future, not now

}

{

     What features should come first?

    1. Donor registration and records of donations. Most important 

2. Lab test results and issuing blood units per buyer(hospital or individual) are very important incase we are ever asked to present these and it will work together. Second most important.

3. Report statistics is useful to us the owners, so that we can refine our business. Just as important as 1, to prevent leaks

Hospital request for blood is great, and will help us in the business process.

{
    Which tests should we record for each donated blood? (For example: HIV, Hepatitis, Malaria, Syphilis)?
    All of them
    1. HIV 1 & 2 (antibody + antigen testing).
    2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
    3. ⁠Hepatitis C (HCV).
    4. ⁠Syphilis (VDRL / TPHA).,
    
    Should the blood be split into parts (like plasma, platelets, red cells), or just kept as whole blood?
    Splitting the blood into components is a wonderful addition, and would come at cost. We need a special license for platelets and co. This part is for the future,
    
    Do you already have rules that say when someone cannot donate blood (like age, weight, health reasons)?
    Anyone can donate, no rules,

{
Do you want the site to show hospitals the real-time stock of blood by type and location?
ANSWER-This is good, but it’s for the future, not now.,

When a hospital requests blood, should the system reserve the unit for some hours before giving it to another hospital? If yes, how long?
ANSWER-This is good, but it’s for the future, not now.,

Do you want the system to remind you about blood expiry dates or storage temperature issues?
Yes, this would be very important to avoid any problems, but I don’t expect the blood to stay in the shelf up to 5days.
Which is why the donor registration is necessary  so we have a sort of donor farm.

    Do we need to follow any official rules or government regulations about how data is stored? if yes, please direct me.
    I wouldn’t know about data storage rules, but for safety, let’s store our data privately accessible only with the highest level of clearance,

    Do you want special security for staff logins (like extra verification, logging staff actions, encrypted data)?
    Yes!!!Staff verification is very important, especially if staff have to use their own account to collect money for blood, let’s know if product was sold or not,

    just to be sure How long should records be kept in the system (for example, 5 years, 10 years, or more or not needed)?
    Lets start with 5years, we can upgrade it as we go along, 



}

{

 Do you want the system to send notifications (SMS, WhatsApp, or Email) when requests are made or blood is available?
 Notifications are important so that we know brought has been sold.,

 Will the site handle payments? If yes, which payment platform do you prefer (Paystack, Flutterwave, or others)?
If t is available, yes. I only wonder if using payment platforms, wouldn’t be burdensome to the people buying blood?,

Do we need to connect this system to any existing hospital software?
No need to connect to anyone else for now.,

}

{

    How many hospitals/centers will start using the site? (1, 5, 10 or more?)
    Individuals are first, as we grow, we will encourage hospitals to begin using the site. ,

    About how many donations do you expect per month?
    Donors would depend on business growth. I am hoping to do 100-200 monthly for a start.

    Will staff use computers only, or also tablets/phones?
    Staff don’t have a restriction on devices to use. Do you have a recommendation?

}

{
  Do you already have a logo, brand colors, or content for the website?
  We don’t have any existing data, so you have creative liberty.

  Do you have any existing data (like Excel or paper records) that should be imported?
  Already have brand colours, have a designer working on the logo. I will communicate that to you once it’s done
