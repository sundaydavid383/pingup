    The feature to allow hospitals have their own landing page and domain on our website is a good idea but it is for the future, not now

    1. Donor registration and records of donations. Most important 

2. Lab test results and issuing blood units per buyer(hospital or individual) are very important incase we are ever asked to present these and it will work together. Second most important.

3. Report statistics is useful to us the owners, so that we can refine our business. Just as important as 1, to prevent leaks

Hospital request for blood is great, and will help us in the business process.}

    All of them
1. HIV 1 & 2 (antibody + antigen testing).
2. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg).
3. ⁠Hepatitis C (HCV).
4. ⁠Syphilis (VDRL / TPHA).,

Splitting the blood into components is a wonderful addition, and would come at cost. We need a special license for platelets and co. This part is for the future,

Anyone can donate, no rules

Do you want the site to show hospitals the real-time stock of blood by type and location?
ANSWER-This is good, but it’s for the future, not now.,

When a hospital requests blood, should the system reserve the unit for some hours before giving it to another hospital? If yes, how long?
ANSWER-This is good, but it’s for the future, not now.,

Do you want the system to remind you about blood expiry dates or storage temperature issues?
Yes, this would be very important to avoid any problems, but I don’t expect the blood to stay in the shelf up to 5days.
Which is why the donor registration is necessary  so we have a sort of donor farm.
